Example: `add todo desc/CS2100 Tutorial date/04-11-2020 time/1100 recurring/1 week`

When this task is marked as done, it will generate another todo with the deadline: `Date: 11-11-2020, Time: 1100`

![recurringTask](images/ExampleOfARecurringTask.png)

##### 2.2.7 Sorting contacts and tasks: `sort`

![sortedTaskList](images/SortedTaskList.PNG)

* Contact, task, and clear are the available options for sort and should be used individually in the `OPTION` field.

* `sort contact` sorts the contact list.

##### 2.2.8 Add common tag to contact + task: `contactTaskTag`

The user can choose to add as many common tags as they want, where they simply just need to input the `t/` prefix.

* `contactTaskTag t/TAG... contactIndex/INDEX taskIndex/INDEX`

![contactTaskTag](images/contactTaskTag.png)

Example:

Upon executing the command, the contact at index 7- “James Ho” and task at index 1- “homework” will have both the tags “CS2100” and “buddy”, which helps in the ease of searching contacts that are associated with a task.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:warning: **Warning:**

It is a coincidence in the example that the index of the "homework" task is 1 for "Due soon" and the whole Tasklist.
